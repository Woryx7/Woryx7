# Hello, World! 👋

My name is Miguel Herrera, I am currently pursuing the Bachelor of Science on Computer Graphics and System Engineering
at Universidad Panamericana. I started out programming with python during high school, and ever since I have been quite 
interested in the possibilities that I could develop with it. Lately I am quite interested in the use of artificial intelligence
and how the math behind of neural networks makes them work.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

I have taken several classes and I have found that I am mainly interested in developing software, backend services and
data science / machine learning applications. I am currently most familiar with the following:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, Javascript, Sql, C#
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Django, Pytorch
- **Tools**: Git
- **Libraries**: React, Pandas, Numpy

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning

This semester we have learned about ray tracing, and parallel programming has caught my interest. I am now learning in the process
of learning the Cuda toolkit. On the other hand, I have grasped the basics regarding simple neural network math, and I am now learning
about pytorch and how to apply it to different areas.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

In my profile you will find several projects, some of them where from when I first started coding and are not very interesting, however 
I feel most proud of the following projects:

- **[Neural Network Guide](https://github.com/herrerpm/Neural-Network)** It is an implementation from the ground up of a neural network, I added a comprehensive guide with several resources on the subject.
- **[Java RayTracer](https://github.com/herrerpm/RayTracer)**: An implementation of a ray tracer in Java featuring, reflection, refraction, Blinn-Phong and other techniques.

## 🤝 Let's Connect and Collaborate
If you're passionate about machine learning, computer graphics, or backend development, I'd love to connect and see how we can learn 
from each other or work together on a project. Feel free to reach out!
